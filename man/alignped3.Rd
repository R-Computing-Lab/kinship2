\title{Third routine alignment}
\usage{
alignped3(x1, x2, packed, space = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{space}{}
}
\value{
A list of element containing:
\item{n}{}
\item{nid}{}
\item{pos}{}
\item{fam}{}
}
\description{
This is the third of the four co-routines.
}
\details{
This co-routine merges two pedigree trees which are side by side into a
single object. The primary special case is when the rightmost person in
the left tree is the same as the leftmost person in the right tree; we
need not plot two copies of the same person side by side.
(When initializing the output structures do not worry about this,
there is no harm if they are a column bigger than finally needed.)
Beyond that the work is simple bookkeeping.

\item{Slide}{ For the unpacked case, which is the traditional way to draw
a pedigree when we can assume the paper is infinitely wide, all parents are
centered over their children. In this case we think if the two trees to be
merged as solid blocks. On input they both have a left margin of 0.
Compute how far over we have to slide the right tree.}
\item{Merge}{ Now merge the two trees. Start at the top level and work down.}
