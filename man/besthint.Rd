\description{
When computer time is cheap, use this routine to get a "best" pedigree.
}
\details{
The autohint routine will rearrange sibling order, but not founder order.
This calls autohint with every possible founder order, and finds that
plot with the least "stress":
       wt[1] * number of dotted arcs
     + wt[2] * lengths of dotted arcs
     + wt[3] * lengths of parent-child
bends perfect: if anything meets this stress level, keep it
