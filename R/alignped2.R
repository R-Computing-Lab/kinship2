#' Second routine alignment
#'
#' @description
#' This is the second of the four co-routines.
#'
#' @details
#' This routine takes a collection of siblings, grows the tree for each,
#' and appends them side by side into a single tree.
#' The input arguments are the same as those to \code{alignped1} with the
#' exception that \code{[[x]]} will be a vector. This routine does nothing
#' to the spouselist matrix, but needs to pass it down the tree and back
#' since one of the routines called by \code{alignped2} might change the matrix.
#'
#' The code below has one non-obvious special case. Suppose that two sibs marry.
#' When the first sib is processed by \code{alignped1} then both partners
#' (and any children) will be added to the rval structure below.
#' When the second sib is processed they will come back as a 1 element tree
#' (the marriage will no longer be on the spouselist), which should be added
#' onto rval. The rule thus is to not add any 1 element tree whose value
#' (which must be \code{x[i]}) is already in the rval structure for this level.
#'
#' @param x
#' @param dad
#' @param mom
#' @param level
#' @param horder
#' @param packed
#' @param spouselist
#'
#' @return A set of matrices along with the spouselist matrix.
#' The latter has marriages removed as they are processed.

        horder, packed, spouselist
      )
      spouselist <- rval2$spouselist

      # Deal with the unusual special case:
      if ((rval2$n[mylev] > 1) ||
        (is.na(match(x[i], floor(rval$nid[mylev, ]))))) {
