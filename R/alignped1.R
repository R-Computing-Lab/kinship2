#' First routine alignment
#'
#' @description
#' This is the first of the four co-routines.
#'
#' @details
#' It is called with a single subject, and returns the subtree founded on said
#' subject, as though it were the only tree.
#'
#' \item{Part 1}{In this routine the \code{[[nid]]} array consists of the final
#' \code{nid array + 1/2} of the final spouse array.
#' Note that the \code{[[spouselist]]} matrix will only contain spouse pairs
#' that are not yet processed. The logic for anchoring is slightly tricky.
#' First, if row 4 of the spouselist matrix is 0, we anchor at the first
#' opportunity. Also note that if \code{spouselist[,3]==spouselist[,4]}
#' it is the husband who is the anchor (just write out the possibilities). }
#' \item{Part 2}{Create the set of 3 return structures, which will be matrices
#' with (1+nspouse) columns.
#' If there are children then other routines will widen the result.}
#' \item{Part 3}{Create the two complimentary lists lspouse and rspouse to
#' denote those plotted on the left and on the right. For someone with lots
#' of spouses we try to split them evenly. If the number of spouses is odd,
#' then men should have more on the right than on the left, women more on the
#' right. Any hints in the spouselist matrix override.
#' We put the undecided marriages closest to \code{[[x]]}, then add
#' predetermined ones to the left and right. The majority of marriages will be
#' undetermined singletons, for which nleft will be 1 for female (put my husband
#' to the left) and 0 for male. In one bug found by plotting canine data,
#' lspouse could initially be empty but \code{length(rspouse)> 1}.
#' This caused \code{nleft>length(indx)}.
#' A fix was to not let indx to be indexed beyond its length,
#' fix by JPS 5/2013.}
#' \item{Part 4}{For each spouse get the list of children. If there are any we
#' call alignped2 to generate their tree and then mark the connection to their
#' parent. If multiple marriages have children we need to join the trees. }
#' \item{Part 5}{ To finish up we need to splice together the tree made up from
#' all the kids, which only has data from lev+1 down, with the data here.
#' There are 3 cases:
#' The first and easiest is when no children were found.
#' The second is when the tree below is wider than the tree here,
#' in which case we add the data from this level onto theirs.
#' The third is when below is narrower, for instance an only child. }

#' The latter has marriages removed as they are processed.
