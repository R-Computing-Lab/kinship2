#' Third routine alignment
#'
#' @description
#' This is the third of the four co-routines.
#'
#' @details
#' This co-routine merges two pedigree trees which are side by side into a
#' single object. The primary special case is when the rightmost person in
#' the left tree is the same as the leftmost person in the right tree; we
#' need not plot two copies of the same person side by side.
#' (When initializing the output structures do not worry about this,
#' there is no harm if they are a column bigger than finally needed.)
#' Beyond that the work is simple bookkeeping.
#'
#' \item{Slide}{ For the unpacked case, which is the traditional way to draw
#' a pedigree when we can assume the paper is infinitely wide, all parents are
#' centered over their children. In this case we think if the two trees to be
#' merged as solid blocks. On input they both have a left margin of 0.
#' Compute how far over we have to slide the right tree.}
#' \item{Merge}{ Now merge the two trees. Start at the top level and work down.}
